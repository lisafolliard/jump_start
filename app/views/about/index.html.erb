<h2>How the Process Works</h2>

<div class='about-page'>
  <p>Critiques are a valuable aspect of the learning process in any art school experience. Feedback will get students used to accepting both criticism and praise and to reexamine their work with fresh eyes. The feedback becomes similar to that of a set of instructions, all with the purpose of driving forward the quality of a piece of work.</p>

  <br>

<p>Common rules used in critique:</p>

  <p><strong>Be kind:</strong> Positive comments should come first and focus entirely on the work. No personal comments, sarcasm or put downs. The comments can be challenging but the creator of the work should feel that the feedback is work orientated and happy to receive it. Hard on content, soft on people.</p>

  <p><strong>Be specific:</strong> Critique with a helpful suggestion. Comments should explain exactly what needs to be worked on (like a set of instructions) which the artist can simply take away and use.</p>

  <p><strong>Be helpful:</strong> Feedback is provided to help make the work better.</p>
